			It's crazy to think that it has already been five weeks since I first started my internship at the MFA and that I was already half way through. <br> <br>

			I opened the door to an empty office, assuming that everyone was at a meeting, and so I took my seat and continued typing out the art information, description, and donors for the Chinese Ceramics Gallery. I had finally finished typing out the descriptions when I decided I wanted to be 100% sure that I hadn't missed any art labels. So I went back to the Chinese Ceramics Gallery and took another round of pictures of each art label in addition to writing down what the name of the piece was and the art number. As a short break, I decided to check my email, where I found an unread email from Quinn saying "Sorry, Raeanne. I've been stuck in a gallery planning meeting. You can work on the Chinese ceramics, check out the jewelry show, or ask if anyone needs help." I responded telling her that I was already working on the Chinese ceramics, but I'd love to check out the jewelry show. <br> <br>

			I headed to the jewelry exhibit with a vague familiarity of where it was. The tiny room was packed. The room where the exhibit was held was almost completely dark, with only spotlights serving as a source of light onto the jewelry. The lighting added a great elegance to the exhibit because it accentuated the shine of the gold and colorful jewels, making it look even more precious and exquisite. I listened to the conversations of the other onlookers, with "jewelry is great because it never gets dated or goes out of style" being my favorite comment. <br><br>

			I headed back to the Design Department after that nice break, and continued working on the art labels. After numerous meetings, Quinn had arrived back to the Design Department, where she asked if I wanted to go on a walk with her and two of the other designers. To end the day, we walked to a gallery that was not yet open, which was about a photographer who had taken pictures of Jewish concentration camps and had buried the negatives, with his photographs being the subject of the exhibit. I watched as the designers made decisions of how they wanted to manipulate the user experience by telling a story through placement and sizing of photos. <br><br>

			Again, one of the best parts about interning at the Museum of Fine Arts is by far having the opportunity to experience the art work not only before everyone else gets to, but what goes on behind the scenes before exhibitions open.
