			<p style="font-famiily: 'open sans';">Starting a new job anywhere is always daunting. You don't know what to expect, how your supervisor is going to be, if you are able to handle the tasks given to you, if this job is something you're happy to wake up to every morning, etc. Starting at the Museum of Fine Arts was just that to meâ€”daunting, but in a good way. I was starting my new internship in the Department of Exhibition and Design in a well renowned institution, and it was exciting. <br><br>

			I made my way across Fenway, through the park and walked through the glass doors of the MFA's staff entrance. Upon entering, I checked in at the front desk, giving the security woman my first and last name, ID, and name of my supervisor, since I had not yet received my MFA ID. <br> <br>

			I took a seat and sat down next to a fellow, excitingly anxious intern whom I had met during orientation, and engaged in a short conversation about what our roles for the MFA would be. A few minutes later, my supervisor, Quinn, came to greet me, and as we were walking upstairs to the second floor, informed me about an Exhibition Presentation from ten to eleven in the morning about upcoming exhibitions through December 2017 to 2018. <br> <br>

			We reach the Art of Asia wing, and she brings me to an obscure door at the end of the hallway, which unexpectedly is the Design Department. I find my place at a desk located right next to the cubicle of my supervisor and she walks me through the process of signing into the computer, where to find the design files for all the galleries, museum databases, etc. <br> <br> 

			As ten o'clock started approaching, we headed to the ground floor to an auditorium for the Exhibition Presentation. They spoke about upcoming exhibitions regarding Native American Art and Greek Art for the upcoming year. <br> <br>

			Next, I had to find my way to the Trustees Ballroom to attend a meeting for interns with Director Matthew Teitlbaum from 11 to 11:30. It took a little while for me to find it, since the MFA is obviously so big, and I had to make sure I had access to entrances that weren't 'staff only' since I didn't have my ID yet. I finally found the room just in time and took a seat. It was more so a Q&A meeting for interns who were curious about anything about the museum, and informed us that the most important thing to keep in mind throughout our internship experience for the next few months is to "keep asking questions, and to not be afraid of doing so." <br> <br>

			After the meeting, Quinn went over a few more logistical things such as typefaces the MFA uses, using character styles for exhibitions, and how files are organized. At around 12:30, it was time for lunch, where I once again got lost looking for the cafeteria. After an hour of eating my lunch while reading 'The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas' for my Philosophy class, I headed back to the Design Department and took my seat, ready for my first task. <br> <br>

			"Hi Raeanne! So this is sort of a small project we need to get done for the Matisse Exhibit. We want to use a photo of Matisse in his studio and blow it up to a larger scale, but the photo we received appears to have had scratches in the negative. Would you be able to fix this on Photoshop?" Nick, one of the designers asked me. <br> <br>

			And so I began my first real task as an intern. I had first tried using the smudge tool to get rid of the scratches; however, because the photo was old, there was a bit of a grain to it, so in order to keep it consistent, I copied and pasted tiny parts of the picture to cover the scratches. In total, it took me about two and a half hours, which was the remainder of the day. I showed the retouched image to Nick, which he quickly approved. <br><br>

			First day, check.
