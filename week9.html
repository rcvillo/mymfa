			Walking into the office, Quinn was at another meeting, so I continued doing spelling and grammar check for the Chinese ceramics exhibition. At around 10am, Quinn came back informing me of another project that had to be completed, which was about the same as the Chinese ceramics project. She took me to the Art of Europe wing, and into the Hamilton Palace room. In the room were cabinets of silver teapots, coffee pots, plates, you name it. One of the signs had incorrect numbering, which I had to fix, but the remainder of the files were also missing, so Quinn asked that I reformat and retype the signage so that they had it for future use.
