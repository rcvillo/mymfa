			By week 4, I had already set up a pretty good routine for my internship. I would wake up at 8:45, get dressed, heat up water for my tea, then be out the door by 9:10 so I can walk across the park from Fenway to get there at exactly 9:30. I swiped in my ID and headed right to the Design Department and took a seat at my desk. <br> <br>

			First order of business: read visitor suggestions to improve user experience at the MFA and create a more user-friendly form which lists common problems people have at the MFA regarding exhibition and design. Upon reading the visitor suggestions, some of them were very critical and particular. I opened up InDesign and ultimately narrowed the list to: poor lighting, mislabeled/misnumbered artwork, spelling/grammatical errors, difficulty reading art labels due to placement, lighting, or text format, and other. <br><br>

			Once I had finished that, Quinn brought me to a meeting with the other designers and curators where they discussed how to improve the display of an installation in the Art of Europe wing. <br> <br>

			After heading back to the Design Department, Quinn asked that I go to the Egyptian gallery where the vinyl for an audio guide where a number had peeled off and needed to be reapplied. Because CFA had provided us with a vinyl cutter last semester, I was familiar with applying vinyl to the surface. However, I ran into a few problems. When I first got there, there were three large groups of students going over the relief sculpture which I had to fix the vinyl for. After about 20 minutes, I had to dig through the large ziplock bag Quinn gave me with numerous numbers of various sizes and shades of gray to see which number would match the ones that weren't peeled off. After about another 20 minutes, I realized that none of the numbers were the same size or color as the numbers that hadn't peeled off yet, so I just removed all the vinyl and reapplied the audio headphones and numbers from scratch. <br><br>

			Next order of business: make xerox copies of about 6 large packets of gallery maps. As I approached my last packet, Quinn told me about this jewelry exhibition that is opening next week, and asked if I wanted to see if it once I reach a stopping point. And so we went to the ground floor, right by the main entrance and showed me the jewelry cases and what was soon to be open to the public, which was particularly cool since I got to see an exhibit before everyone else does. <br><br>

			Finally, to end the day, I again continued working on the Chinese Ceramics Gallery art labels. However, Quinn informed me that the curator didn't have the previous files, so I would have to re-type all the labels from scratch. <br>

			Week four, check.
