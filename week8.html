			A little more than halfway through my internship at the MFA, and today was pretty low key. I walked into work, and Quinn had requested that I work on a few Department Office signage, since some of the departments' names had been changed. I worked on a few different formats, where the Department of Art of Asia and the Department of Art of Africa and Oceania were on different labels, each with the room number, and where the Departments were on the same label, but the width had been scaled up (same goes for the Department of Prints and Drawings and the Department of Photography). Ultimately, we chose the ones where the departments were on the same label, since I thought having them on two separate labels with the same room number on each seemed redundant.

<br><br>Next, Quinn had me open the 'Coming Soon' Exhibition templates, and swap out the picture, and name, date, and gallery on the poster for the upcoming Indian painting exhibit. She had given me five pictures to choose from, and I couldn't decide between one, where I liked the composition of the painting with the two figures, and another one, where I thought the colors were eye-catching. I asked Quinn for her input, and she agreed that it was difficult to decide between the two, so we decided to use both, since it would be a double sided poster.

<br><br>For the remainder of the day, I just did admin work and filled out an Excel spreadsheet (Thank you Intro to Finance and Financial/Managerial accounting for teaching me Excel) that lists upcoming Exhibitions, and what installations/deinstallations need to be made and by whom.
