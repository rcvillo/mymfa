			Because of Winter Storm Stella that occurred yesterday, the Design and Exhibition team at the MFA was very behind with the Memory Unearthed exhibit (since the completion of the exhibit is Friday, March 17); Therefore, there was a lot of vinyl that had to be weeded and then hung up on the walls.

Now if you're a perfectionist, you don't realize how much of one you are until you deal with small scale vinyl typography. I spent the entire morning reviewing the timeline regarding Jewish concentration camps and making sure there were no missing letters, punctuation, or dots on the 'i's. My perfectionism came in when some of the 'i's that had already been placed were not completely straight, not directly above the line, or the space between the line and the 'i' was too large. Same goes for kerning of the letters within words. 

After lunch, I spent the rest of the afternoon weeding out more vinyl, except the type that needed to be applied was particularly small. Because this was my first time weeding vinyl of that size, it took me a while to get into the groove of realizing the best way to not accidentally lose a letter, or a comma, or the dots on the 'i's (which was the hardest part), but eventually I was able to tackle the very meticulous task.
