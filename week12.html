			I woke up this morning with a bittersweet feeling. I headed towards Fenway for my final walk to the Museum of Fine Arts, thinking "not only will this be my last day working at the MFA, but it'll also probably be my last time I'll be in the MFA for a while after graduation." <br><br> I walked into the office and sat down on my desk and turned on the computer. No response. I turned off and on the power strip and checked to make sure the outlet was working. Again, no response. Quinn wasn't there so I asked the Senior Graphic Designer for help. She tried all the same things I had tried, until she eventually had to get one of the other designers to help us out. He restarted the fuse box for my area and alas, it had worked. I logged onto my email and found an email from Quinn, telling me to wrap up any projects I had been working on from the semester, and to check out the Boticelli exhibit on the ground floor. I continued spelling and grammar checking the Hamilton Palace exhibition graphics and once I had finished that, I went downstairs to see the Boticelli exhibit, which is the biggest Boticelli show there has been in the Northeast. The thing I'll miss most about my internship is opportunities like this, where I can just walk down the hall and see some of the greatest works of art, as if it were not big deal. By the time I had gotten back, Quinn had invited me for pizza to celebrate the completion of both my internship and of the busy few weeks the team has had. The entire team and I walked to a small pizza place by Northeastern, where we split two eggplant pizzas, a mushroom pizza, and a four cheese pizza. Our conversations varied from things such as Quinn's upcoming trip to Hawaii, marathons and half marathons, to vacuum cleaners. <br><br> After arriving back from lunch, Quinn requested wayfinding signage for the Boticelli exhibit, which took the remainder of the afternoon. I designed, printed, then trimmed the signage, and had finally reached the end. I said goodbye to Quinn and the team and went on my own way.
