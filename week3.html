			I arrived at the MFA staff entrance and walked through the two glass doors. This time, walking in was no problem. I tapped my ID on the staff entrance buzzer and continued on to the next set of glass double doors. I took a left at the elevator, and then stopped. <i> Is it left? Is it right? How do I get up? </i> I decided to make a right, and continue through another set of double doors. I am encountered by a room with three other sets of double doors. I chose the one that seemed most familiar to me, and made my way up. I arrived to the second floor, and it took a while for me to orient myself, but I did it. I made my way to the Design Department and took a seat at my desk. <br> <br>

			I immediately resumed where I had left off last week with the Duccio triptych label. Quinn and I walked to the Art of Europe wing and entered the room with the Gothic artwork. Since I had printed extras, Quinn showed me how to properly apply the label onto the label stand. You would think that after having had to wrap my textbooks in plastic wrap all through grade school and high school free of air bubbles, this would be no problem for me. But let's just say my first application wasn't the prettiest. I peeled it off and tried again with the last art label I had printed. This time, Quinn advised that I rub it on with a lighter touch, and so I did just that. Perfect. <br><br>

			We headed back to the Design Department, where we soon had to leave for a meeting. During that meeting they touched upon three different subjects. The first was a summer STEAM (Science Technology Engineering Art and Math) initiative fellowship for high school juniors. The second subject was about interactive touch screens used to learn more about artwork and their affects on Museum visitors. The speakers noted that the use of the interactive effectively made people stay longer as well as form more thorough analyses of the art. Finally, the third subject talked about cleaning Manet's 'Sreet Singer Painting' by using UV light and X-rays. They discovered that the painting was trimmed by ten centimeters, the jawline of the street singer had been altered, and the cleaning revealed cooler tones, colors, and brushstrokes that were not originally visible before the cleaning <br> <br> 

			Finally, to end the day, I continued on with doing inventory for the Chinese Ceramics gallery. Third day, done.
