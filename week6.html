			Have you ever taken those Buzzfeed quizzes that test how good your color vision is? They're those quizzes that play mind games on you and that make your brain go crazy due to the back and forth between, is it this red that's slightly lighter, or this red that's slightly darker, so that it can match this specific shade of Scarlet, for example. If you haven't, feel free to try it <a style="href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/nathanwpyle/can-you-see-the-correct-shade-of-color-in-these-gradients?utm_term=.mco3EvWB2#.nwnqNkP8Y"> here</a>.

			So, what'd you think? It's a lot harder than you think right? <br> <br>

			Today, Quinn asked me to do the real-life equivalent. I had to color match three different walls which were each three different shades of gray, and once I reached a shade I was satisfied with, I had to write down the CMYK values of the swatches that were closest to the paint. <br> <br>

			Second question: How long do you think it would take to color match three walls? Two hours, tops? <br>
			Surprisingly, it took me the entirety of the day, meaning 9:30am until 4pm, which is what Quinn warned me it would take. <br> <br>

			The process required going through each of the three walls and comparing CMYK swatches to the sheet of grays. Then, I brought those values onto the computer and increased or decreased the blue and black values in 11 different ways in case the paint in the gallery was cooler or warmer, darker or lighter. Once I had finished the 11 variations, I printed it out on a printer, and brought them back to the gallery to compare. I took note of things like "this gray should be two points cooler", or "this gray is too dark." After six tries, I had finally found three perfect grays to match the three painted walls for the Memory Unearthed exhibit which will showcase photographs from the Jewish Concentration Camps.
