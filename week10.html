			Today was a particularly good day, because I HAD JUST GOTTEN EMPLOYED!!! I just received the phone call as I walking to the MFA, so to say that my walk across the park was pleasant would be an understatement. I walked into the office and continued working on the Hamilton Palace exhibition graphics. I was halfway done from when I had first started working on it, and it was a bit tedious because I had to retype everything out. Upon completing it, I double and triple checked for spelling and grammatical errors, and even on the third check, there were still a few. At the end of the day, Quinn took me to see the Matisse exhibit before it was open to the public. I got to see all the work before everyone else, and hear the reason as to why they made the design decisions they did. I also got to see the large scale photoshopped image of Matisse I had worked on during my very first day!
