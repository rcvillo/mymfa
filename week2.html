			"Keep asking questions" was the quote from last week that stuck most to me as I made my way across the park from Fenway, ready to embark on my second day at the Museum of Fine Arts. I was particularly eager to start because 1. I had already gotten my first day jitters out of the way and 2. Now that I had finished all the "intern orientation, welcome to the team" activities, I was ready to start doing actual work. <br> <br>

			I walked into the MFA staff entrance, and because I had still not yet gotten my ID yet, I gave Quinn's name to the security woman at the front door and waited to be let in. We walked to the Art of Asia wing and into the Design Department as we did last week and I took my seat at my desk. The first mode of business was to learn the print settings and which printers were used for what. After Quinn had given me the run down on all the printers, she gave me an MFA map and installation signs, which needed to be trimmed. With a ruler and an exacto knife, I trimmed the signage as precisely as possible. <br><br>

			I headed back to my desk, where Quinn was packing up to go to a meeting. Before she left, she asked if I would mind doing admin work for her. There were three piles that needed to be packed into an envelope. One was a pile of gallery case materials, another was a stack of papers that had case material information and descriptions written by the MFA, and the last pile was another stack of papers given by the suppliers which listed even more information about that particular material. My task was to make sure the papers matched up with the case material to be placed into an envelope so that they could get tested in the Science Research Department for the Greek Daily Life Gallery. Surprisingly, it took a lot longer than expected, as some of the suppliers are Italian, meaning the descriptions were Italian. Using my basic knowledge of Spanish (since Spanish and Italian are very similar), I was able to match up some of the descriptions given by the Italian suppliers with the English descriptions written by the MFA. By the time I was done, Quinn had arrived back from her meeting. <br><br>

			Next, we took a quick walk right outside of the Design Department, where Quinn pointed out some damaged labels in the Chinese Ceramics gallery. As a longer term project, she requested that I check which labels we had on the server, and which ones were missing, since they were all created at various points in time. Any of the labels we didn't have, I would let her know and she would contact the curator so that she could email the label descriptions back to us. So I began doing so, by first taking pictures of each of the ceramic pieces, then heading back to my desk and writing which pieces weren't on file. <br> <br>

			As three o'clock approached, Quinn asked that I create a new label for a Duccio triptych that had been damaged in the Art of Europe wing. She began explaining where it was located; however, because I had written an Art History paper on it a few years ago, I knew exactly where it was. On my way there, I passed a number of Impressionist paintings (my favorite art time period) and evenutally hit an exhibit by my favorite artist, Claude Monet. I then realized that this was my favorite part of working at the MFA (yes, I realize it was only my second day): I am surrounded by some of the best artwork known and can easily come across it at any given time. After a brief browse through Monet's paintings, I found the Duccio triptych, took a picture of the sign that I needed to replicate and headed back. Once I got back, I printed the sign from a previous file, ready to be trimmed and put up. However, before I could do so, Quinn told me to just wait till next week to put it up, since I still needed to get my MFA ID.

			<br> <br> We headed to the ground floor, into the security office, and I filled out paperwork that requested my name, address, phone number, and driver's license number. The man at the security office took a picture of me, and with (what felt like) a snap of his finger, I had my MFA ID. Who knew that one little card of plastic could make this internship experience feel so real?<br> <br>
